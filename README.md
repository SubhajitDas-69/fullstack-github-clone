# Full Stack GitHub Clone  
*A GitHub-like Repository Management Platform built with the MERN stack.*

Full Stack GitHub Clone is a **full stack web application** inspired by GitHub.  
It replicates essential features of repository management and includes an **issue tracking system** where users can collaborate through issue creation, comments, commits, and status updates.  
Users can simulate Git commands (`init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `revert`), manage repositories, and interact by starring or following other users.

> Note: Issue updates (like new comments or status changes) currently appear after a page refresh. Real-time updates are planned for future versions.
